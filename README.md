# routines

just some brainstorming:
1. app lives just in the background, hopefully not sucking too much memory
2. app identifies patterns of user's repeated actions
3. app makes action suggestions based on collected data (obv. a very big privacy concern, so i'll be super transparent, keep code open source, and run locally rather than send data off-device)
4. app can replay a routine in the background (like clicking a button or something on a webpage) so user can do new, fun stuff
5. app gives detailed report on what apps had the most usage and what routines were most common for a specific day.
6. app lets user record/create their own routine, such as opening a web app, and set a gentle suggestion to appear according to their schedule
